# GDPAnomalyInjector — canonical context

Personal research project **"GDP: Anomaly Injection"** (intrusive UE5 track). This is a
UE5 plugin that injects **labeled visual anomalies** (graphics bugs — missing objects,
lighting mismatch, LOD corruption, flicker, etc.) into UE5 games, to generate synthetic
training data for bug-detection ML. It is **game-agnostic** (public UE APIs only) and is
tested on Stack O Bot. A separate non-intrusive tool exists elsewhere and is out of scope.

This file is the **canonical entry point**. The folder it lives in is its own git repository
and is the single source of truth for the project.

## Current status — keep this current; it is the cold-start "you are here"
- **Latest as-built:** **M1 — Anomaly Abstraction & Registry — COMPLETE** (the `IGDPAnomaly` interface +
  subsystem-owned registry + three anomalies: `missing_object`, `flicker`, `time_dilation`).
  **All 8 stage gates passed** — clean headless compile + gates 2–7 verified live in PIE `MainWorld`
  (unreal-mcpython bridge + owner eyeball, 2026-06-09).
  → `docs/sessions/2026-06-09-003-m1-implementation.md`, `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Resolved:** **AMB-3 → capture-baseline** — `time_dilation` Revert restores the pre-Apply value
  (not a hardcoded `1.0`). See journal 003 + gotcha G11.
- **In flight:** none. **Next action:** awaiting the next milestone brief. The locked `IGDPAnomaly`
  interface + registry are the foundation; "how to add an anomaly" is in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Milestones: M0 (`…-001`) and M1 (`…-003`) both fully passed.

## Documentation system — how these docs fit together (read in this order)
- **CLAUDE.md** (this file) — canonical context, environment, invariants, workflow rules, and the
  **Current status** above. Start here.
- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** — **living** current-as-built design reference
  + the **anomaly catalog**. "The whole picture in one read." Describes only what is in the code
  *now*; forward plans live in the journals, never here.
- **[docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md)** — what this is, how the work is run, where things live.
- **[docs/setup-runbook.md](docs/setup-runbook.md)** — **living** recipe to build/run from scratch.
- **[docs/gotchas.md](docs/gotchas.md)** — **append-only** non-obvious lessons (G1, G2, …).
- **[docs/sessions/](docs/sessions/)** — one journal per session, `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-slug.md`: the
  chronological record (Goal / What done / Problem→Resolution / Deviations / State / Hand-off) and
  the home for milestone **plans** and **design decisions** (including open/blocking ones).

## Environment
- Engine: **source-built UE 5.4.4** at `D:\UESource\UnrealEngine` (registered to the
  `.uproject`'s `EngineAssociation` GUID under `HKCU\Software\Epic Games\Unreal Engine\Builds`).
- Host project: **StackOBot** at `D:\Unreal Projects\StackOBot` (note the space in the path).
- Plugin in-tree at `D:\Unreal Projects\StackOBot\Plugins\GDPAnomalyInjector\`.
- Windows, MSVC. Build target: **StackOBotEditor / Development / Win64**.
- Functional smoke tests run in **PIE via the `unreal-mcpython` MCP bridge** (host tooling, NOT part
  of this repo — see gotcha G8). State/log reads close the non-visual gates; the owner eyeballs visuals.

## Architecture (current as-built: M0 — full detail in docs/architecture.md)
- One **Runtime** module `GDPAnomalyInjector`, `LoadingPhase = Default`, `EnabledByDefault: true`.
- Build.cs deps: `Core`, `CoreUObject`, `Engine` (later may add `Renderer`, `RenderCore`, `RHI`,
  `Slate`, `InputCore`).
- Core injector = a `UTickableWorldSubsystem` (`UGDPAnomalyInjectorSubsystem`) — auto-ticks,
  world-scoped, gives `GetWorld()`. Restricted to **Game + PIE** worlds via `DoesSupportWorldType`
  (never the editor preview world).
- Control surface = console commands via `FAutoConsoleCommandWithWorldAndArgs`, module-scoped,
  resolving the subsystem from the world the console passes in, null-guarded.
- M0 anomaly = ONE hardcoded hide (`GDP.HideActor` / `GDP.ShowAllActors`). The general anomaly
  **interface + registry is the M1 design** (see Current status + journal 002), not yet in code.

## Invariants (do not violate)
- **Plugin stays game-agnostic.** The `GDPAnomalyInjector` module may depend only on
  `Core`/`CoreUObject`/`Engine` (later `Renderer`/`RenderCore`/`RHI`/`Slate`/`InputCore`)
  and must **never `#include` or reference host game-module types** (e.g. anything from the
  `StackOBot` module). Host-specific buildability lives in the project, never in the plugin.
- **Matching is label-free.** Targeting matches by actor Name or Class only.
  `GetActorLabel()` is editor-only and absent in cooked builds — `ListActors` may print the
  label (guarded by `WITH_EDITOR`) but nothing matches on it.

## Workflow & doc-maintenance rules
- **Two-Claude split.** Design decisions come from an orchestrating "chat Claude" and are
  ferried by Kavin (project owner). The implementing Claude implements. Genuine design forks
  or ambiguities are surfaced back (listed standalone), not improvised.
- **Plan-before-code.** A new milestone's first response is a file-by-file plan only; no
  implementation until approved.
- **Commits — Conventional Commits.** Prefixes: `feat:` (new anomaly or capability), `fix:` (bug),
  `docs:` (doc-only), `refactor:` (no behavior change), `chore:` (build/tooling). Scope anomaly-specific
  changes, e.g. `feat(flicker): …`. **Tag each milestone** with `git tag m<N>` after its commit so
  milestones diff cleanly (`m1..m2`, and a changelog can be auto-derived later). The git repo is the
  plugin folder (`master`); host scaffolding lives outside it and is not committed here.
- **Doc discipline — leave the docs able to (a) cold-start a fresh session and (b) explain the
  whole plugin to any UE dev.** When you start or advance a milestone you MUST, before the session
  closes:
  1. Update **Current status** (above) — the single "you are here" marker (latest as-built /
     in flight / open decisions / next action).
  2. Update **docs/architecture.md** to match the new as-built state, including the **anomaly
     catalog** — describe current code only, never aspirational.
  3. Write/append the **session journal** under `docs/sessions/` (history + the milestone plan +
     design decisions, including any open/blocking decisions).
  4. **Append** new lessons to `docs/gotchas.md` (never delete; supersede).
  5. Keep `docs/setup-runbook.md` and `docs/onboarding.md` current with the build/run steps and
     the control surface as they actually are.
  - Division of labor: **architecture.md = current state** ("what it is"); **journals = history +
    plans** ("how we got here / where we're going"); **runbook = repro**; **gotchas = lessons**.
