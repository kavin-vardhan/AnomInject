"""
verify_capture.py - draw the capture's bounding boxes onto COPIES of the frames, for HUMAN INSPECTION.

THIS IS NOT A LABEL PRODUCER. The engine-side labels are authoritative and this tool never writes,
edits or second-guesses them. It reads what was written and draws it, so a person can look at a frame
and see what the dataset claims about it. The use case it exists for: an anomaly nobody can spot by
eye - rocks on the ground with a missing texture - was annotated correctly, and the overlay is how you
confirm that rather than take it on faith.

It writes annotated COPIES into <dir>/annotated/ and never modifies a captured frame.

ONLY FRAMES THAT CARRY AT LEAST ONE BOX ARE WRITTEN. On a typical session most frames have no
anomaly on them, and an annotated copy of such a frame is a byte-for-byte duplicate of the original
apart from the legend - at 3200x2000 that is a lot of disk for nothing. So the output directory is a
SPARSE, NON-CONTIGUOUS sequence, and the gaps are frames with nothing to draw, not missing data.
The summary line always states how many frames had boxes, how many images were written, and out of
how many total frames, so a gap never has to be guessed at.

THE OUTPUT FILENAME KEEPS THE ORIGINAL FRAME INDEX - frame_00045.png becomes
frame_00045_annotated.png. Nothing is ever renumbered: the number IS the 0-based session index, and
cross-referencing an overlay against annotation.json is the entire point of the tool.

A frame counts as carrying a box if it has at least one RED (shipped) or AMBER (candidate) box.
AMBER-ONLY frames ARE written - finding where a dropped or non-shipped label sat is exactly what
this is used for. --red-only narrows it to frames with a shipped label; it is OFF by default.

TWO COLOURS, and the difference is the point:

  RED    the event is in annotation.json for that frame. This is a SHIPPED label - it is in the
         dataset the client receives.

  AMBER  the box is in labels.jsonl but NOT in annotation.json for that frame. It is a CANDIDATE that
         did not become a shipped label. Each amber box is tagged with why, as far as the artifacts
         can tell:
           OUTSIDE-SUBSET  the event IS annotated, but not on this frame. For hide-type anomalies
                           (blink, missing_object) annotation.json carries only the frames where the
                           object was actually HIDDEN, while labels.jsonl covers the whole fire-active
                           window including the lead-in and the un-hidden half of each blink. This is
                           BY DESIGN and is the common case by a wide margin.
           NON-MANIFESTED  the event is annotated with manifested:false - the hide was ordered but
                           never reached the pixels, so it carries no positive frames (m23).
           VETOED          no such event survives in annotation.json and run_summary reports vetoed
                           events - the pixel veto measured the target drawing zero pixels and removed
                           the event before annotation.json was written (m26/m27).
           UNMATCHED       no such event in annotation.json and nothing reports a veto. Unexpected;
                           worth reporting.

    python verify_capture.py --dir <sessionDir> [--out <annotatedDir>] [--quiet] [--red-only]
