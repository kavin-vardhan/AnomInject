measure_label_offset.py - measure WHERE ANOMALIES ACTUALLY MANIFEST IN PIXELS against WHERE THE
ANNOTATIONS CLAIM THEY ARE, per event, and print a compact per-type offset table.

Read-only diagnostic. It never writes into a session directory and never modifies the plugin, the
engine or the dashboard. It reads a finished capture session off disk (PNG frames + annotation.json
[+ labels.jsonl] [+ a UE log]) and answers one question: for each annotated event, how many frames
separate the annotation from the pixels?

STDLIB + PILLOW ONLY. No numpy, no OpenCV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INDEX CONVENTION - stated because viewers that count from 1 have caused phantom off-by-ones here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PNG filename index IS the session index and it is 0-BASED.

    Actual_Frames/frame_00000.png  ==  session index 0  ==  annotation frame_indices value 0
    labels.jsonl "session_index"   ==  that same 0-based number
    labels.jsonl "frame_index"     ==  the ENGINE frame counter (GFrameCounter). NOT a session index.

A media player or image viewer that numbers the first frame "1" will appear to disagree with this
tool by exactly +1. It is the viewer that is offset, not the data. This tool prints the convention in
its own output header so a screen photo of a result carries it.

Per session the tool verifies that every annotated frame index has a corresponding PNG on disk and
reports any miss LOUDLY, before any offset is computed. That check exists so a numbering artifact
cannot masquerade as an offset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGN CONVENTION - one convention everywhere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    offset  =  MANIFESTED  -  ANNOTATED      (in frames)

    POSITIVE  =  the pixels LAG the label   (the label is stamped EARLY / upstream of rendering)
    NEGATIVE  =  the pixels LEAD the label  (the label is stamped LATE)

This applies to startDelta, endDelta and to the hide-type best shift alike.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW A FRAME IS JUDGED MANIFESTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGION.  Per event, the region is that event's own bbox, taken from labels.jsonl:
    bbox_px   = [x, y, width, height]   in written-frame pixels, already clamped to the frame
    bbox_norm = [x0, y0, x1, y1]        normalized CORNERS, NOT x/y/w/h, and NOT clamped
bbox_px is preferred; bbox_norm x image size is the fallback. Frames outside the annotated window
carry no label row at all, so those frames use the event's MODAL bbox (the most frequent bbox across
the event's labelled frames). Per-frame bbox variation is reported as bbox_jitter_px and lowers
confidence. If neither field is reachable - notably a DELIVERY-MODE session, where labels.jsonl is
not written at all - the region degrades to the FULL FRAME and the event is reported with
region_source=fullframe and reduced confidence. It is never silently dropped.

BASELINE.  Frames outside EVERY annotated window in the session (the union of all events' windows,
each padded by BASELINE_GUARD frames) are eligible. If a dense burst schedule leaves fewer than
BASELINE_MIN eligible frames, the guard is RELAXED (2 -> 1 -> 0) and the guard actually used is
printed - a five-burst 60-frame leg leaves exactly one eligible frame at guard 2.

The event then takes up to BASELINE_N eligible frames, ranked by (distance to the window, then
BEFORE-the-window first, then index) and admitted only while the whole set stays within
BASELINE_SPREAD frames end to end. The spread cap is the part that matters, and it was added after
measurement: on a session whose camera is still settling, a "nearest N before the window" set can
reach back into the settle, and its own internal variance then inflates the threshold until real
manifestations read as nothing. Measured on a MainWorld leg: the same annotated frame reads 0.31
against a settle-era reference and 0.048 against a near one. If no capped set reaches BASELINE_MIN
the cap is relaxed (x2, x4, unbounded) and the tag in baseline_side records which applied.

Ranking by distance with BEFORE winning the tie is the brief's "prefer before, fall back to after";
the resulting set MAY straddle the window when the nearest clean frames lie on both sides, and
baseline_side says "before", "after" or "straddle" so the reader always knows.

SIGNAL.  Every baseline frame is used as a REFERENCE, not just one. For frame f and reference b:

         raw(f,b)     = mean |gray(f) - gray(b)| over the region, in 0..1 units
         ambient(f,b) = the same quantity over a RING around the region (the region dilated by
                        RING_DILATE_PX, minus the region itself)
         net(f,b)     = raw(f,b) - ambient(f,b)

    References whose ambient exceeds max(AMBIENT_REF_FACTOR x min_ambient, min_ambient +
    AMBIENT_REF_FLOOR) are DISCARDED for that frame - a reference the camera has drifted far from is
    not a usable comparison, and its raw and ambient both inflate and falsely cancel. At least
    NET_QUANTILE_INDEX+1 references always survive.

         net(f) = the (NET_QUANTILE_INDEX+1)-th SMALLEST net(f,b) over the surviving references

    Near-minimum rather than mean, because a clean frame need only match ONE clean reference to be
    clean, while an anomalous frame must differ from ALL of them. That is what cancels camera drift:
    measured on a MainWorld leg, an annotated frame reads 0.31 against a settle-era reference and
    0.020 against a near one, and taking the near-minimum recovers a clean 9x separation where a
    single fixed reference gave none. Not the outright minimum, because one reference may itself be
    contaminated (see BASELINE CONTAMINATION below); the second-smallest tolerates exactly one.

    Subtracting ambient is what stops camera motion, a passing mover or a lighting change from
    faking a manifestation: a whole-frame change lifts the ring as much as the region and cancels.
    The ring is unavailable when the region IS the frame (camera_clipping labels the whole frame; a
    delivery-mode fallback does too) or when the ring is thinner than RING_MIN_PX pixels. Then
    ambient_mode is "none", net == raw, and confidence is capped at MED. Reported, not hidden.

THRESHOLD.  Self-calibrated from that event's OWN baseline noise, ROBUSTLY:

    base_vals = net(b) for every baseline frame b, each measured against the OTHER baseline frames
    T         = median(base_vals) + K * 1.4826 * MAD(base_vals) + SIGNAL_FLOOR

A frame is MANIFESTED when net(f) > T. Median and MAD rather than mean and standard deviation
because a contaminated baseline frame is a single large outlier that would otherwise inflate T until
the real anomaly disappears beneath it - measured: one settle-era frame in a five-frame baseline
raised T by roughly 4x. SIGNAL_FLOOR exists because a settled camera with a deterministic renderer
can produce byte-identical baseline frames, which would otherwise yield T = 0 and call rounding
noise a manifestation.

BASELINE CONTAMINATION - the failure this instrument is most likely to hit, made LOUD.
    The baseline is chosen from frames the ANNOTATION says are clean. If the annotation is offset by
    more than the clean gap between bursts, some of those frames are anomalous in the pixels, and a
    naive instrument then reports a confident, WRONG, UNDER-READ offset. So: any baseline frame
    whose own net exceeds T is counted in baseline_contaminated, the row drops to LOW confidence,
    and the type line prints a *** BASELINE CONTAMINATED *** banner naming the risk.
    THE HARD LIMIT THIS IMPLIES, stated rather than discovered later: THE MEASURABLE OFFSET IS
    BOUNDED BY THE CLEAN GAP BETWEEN ANNOTATED WINDOWS. On the standard 2/4/8/4/0 capture config
    that gap is about four frames. Beyond it the tool reports contamination, low confidence or
    UNMEASURABLE - it does not report a confident wrong number. Verified by construction: a +-3
    shift applied to a real bench session raises the banner on most events, while the same +-3 on a
    sparse synthetic session (18 clean frames between windows) reads back as exactly +-3.

Every constant is printed in the output header, so a photograph of the console carries the
configuration that produced the numbers.

UNMEASURABLE.  A frame is UNMEASURABLE when ambient(f) > AMBIENT_FACTOR * T - ambient change is too
large to separate signal from it. An event is UNMEASURABLE when it has fewer than 3 baseline frames,
when fewer than MIN_MEASURABLE_FRAC of its evaluated frames are measurable, when its region is
degenerate, or when nothing manifests anywhere near its window. Unmeasurable is REPORTED as such and
never replaced by a guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PER-TYPE LAYERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIDE TYPES (blink / blinking / missing_object) - and any event whose annotated frame set has GAPS.
    A blink event's annotated set is deliberately NON-CONTIGUOUS: {40,41,45,46} means
    disappear / reappear / disappear / reappear. Reducing it to a start and an end would destroy the
    structure that makes the alignment measurable, so this path does not.
    The annotated indicator A(f) and the measured indicator M(f) are built over the event's
    neighbourhood, and the best integer shift s in [-SHIFT_RANGE, +SHIFT_RANGE] is the one maximizing
    agreement between A(f) and M(f+s). Reported: best shift, agreement at that shift, and agreement
    at shift 0. BEST SHIFT IS THE EVENT'S OFFSET for hide types.
    AGREEMENT IS BALANCED ACCURACY - the mean of the true-positive rate over annotated frames and the
    true-negative rate over the rest. Plain accuracy is dominated by the many correct negatives in the
    padding and barely moves when a 4-frame set is misaligned; balanced accuracy does move. Plain
    accuracy is carried in the CSV as agreement_best_raw / agreement_0_raw for anyone who wants it.

MISSING_TEXTURE / CORRUPTED_TEXTURE - contiguous window; startDelta and endDelta.
    Manifested frames are additionally classified MAGENTA / CHECKER / OTHER.
      MAGENTA - proximity to the corruption material's colour, tested RELATIVELY so that a LIT
                magenta surface still passes: min(R,B) > MAGENTA_MIN_RB, G < MAGENTA_G_RATIO*min(R,B),
                |R-B| < MAGENTA_RB_RATIO*max(R,B), over at least MAGENTA_FRAC_MIN of the region.
                An absolute-brightness form of this test was tried first and MISSED real magenta
                frames whose lit pixels sat below the absolute floor; the relative form reads the
                same frames at 0.20-0.37 of the region while reading 0.000 on checkered ones.
      CHECKER - a grey/white grid, by EITHER of two routes, both requiring low mean saturation:
                (a) ABSOLUTE - high per-pixel edge energy plus a strongly bimodal luminance
                    histogram (Otsu split) with both modes well populated. Catches a high-contrast
                    checker outright.
                (b) DIFFERENTIAL - edge energy at least CHECKER_EDGE_GAIN times the SAME REGION's
                    edge energy in the nearest baseline frame. Route (b) exists because route (a)
                    alone was measured FAILING on a real case and for an instructive reason: a bbox
                    holding a dark object against a bright background is strongly bimodal whether or
                    not a checker is present, so the absolute statistics of the anomalous frame and
                    the clean frame were nearly identical (sep 0.739 vs 0.720, conc 0.914 vs 0.943).
                    The only quantity that moved was edge energy, 0.0081 -> 0.0108. A differential
                    test reads that; an absolute one cannot.
                NOTE the region is the whole bbox, background included, so a target that fills
                little of its own rect dilutes the concentration statistic. CHECKER_CONC_MIN is set
                low enough for the measured real cases (0.446-0.696) and is a stated soft spot.
    THIS CLASSIFICATION IS INFORMATIONAL ONLY. Manifested-or-not always comes from the generic
    net-vs-threshold signal above, never from the classifier. The classifier runs on both texture
    ids because the two share one detector pair and the split is what identifies which material
    actually reached the frame.

LOD_POPPING / LOD_CORRUPTION - contiguous; expect small step changes.
    peak_net and its ratio to the threshold are reported so a low signal is visible rather than
    rounded away, and a confidence rating is mandatory.

EVERYTHING ELSE - generic signal plus confidence, contiguous unless the annotated frame set itself
    has gaps, in which case the set-alignment path is used and the row says so.

SESSION-SPANNING EVENTS - an event annotated over SESSION_SPAN_FRAC or more of the session (the
    shape camera_clipping takes: a Global-scoped anomaly held for the whole run) is reported
    UNMEASURABLE:session-spanning-no-negative-reference and no offset is emitted for it. This is
    structural, not a tuning choice: every frame in the session is inside its window, so there is no
    clean frame anywhere to compare against, and any number produced would be measured against a
    reference that carries the anomaly too. Such an event is also excluded from BLOCKING other
    events' baselines - otherwise one session-wide global anomaly makes every object-scoped event in
    the same session unmeasurable as well. To measure a session-spanning anomaly's offset you need a
    session in which it toggles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOG JOIN (optional, auto-detected, never fatal)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a UE log sits inside or beside a session directory, or is named with --log, the m31 handshake
trace is parsed. THE EXACT TOKENS PARSED, so their presence can be confirmed off a screen:

    Capture(sve): SVE-WANT-TRACE arm <i>/<limit> requestId=<n> gameFrame=<n> pendingAfter=<n>
    Capture(sve): SVE-WANT-TRACE publish <i>/<limit> familyFrame=<n> wanted=<0|1> requestId=<n> pendingBefore=<n>
    Capture(sve): SVE-WANT-SUMMARY marksIssued=<n> publishesSeen=<n> wantedMatches=<n> submitsIssued=<n> framesWritten=<n> pendingWantedAtEnd=<n> maxPendingDepth=<n>
    Capture(async): CAP-PAIR-DROP completed frame id=<n> has no pending snapshot

The trace is bounded to the first 64 arms and the first 64 publishes per run, so joins exist only for
the first <=64 captured frames. That bound is reported with the result.

SERIAL to SESSION-INDEX MAPPING - stated because it is load-bearing and because one of the two
routes is NOT always safe:
  ROUTE A (preferred, exact).  The arm line's gameFrame is GFrameCounter at the arm site. That is the
      same value labels.jsonl records as "frame_index". So gameFrame -> labels.jsonl frame_index ->
      session_index. Requires labels.jsonl, i.e. a delivery-OFF session.
  ROUTE B (fallback, ordinal).  requestId is a plugin-owned monotonic serial minted once per armed
      frame. Within one run it increases by one per captured frame, so
      session_index = requestId - min(requestId over that run's arm lines).
      Subtracting the run minimum is REQUIRED: the serial is a subsystem member that is NOT reset at
      StartRun, so in a process that captured twice the second run's serials do not start at 1. A
      raw "session_index = requestId - 1" would be wrong for every run but the first.
When both routes resolve for the same arm they are cross-checked and the agreement count is printed.

A log may contain SEVERAL capture runs, and a log handed to several sessions belongs to at most one
of them. Runs are segmented on "arm 1/" (the trace index resets per run) and each segment records the
timestamp of its first arm line. A segment is attributed to a session only when that timestamp falls
within LOG_TIME_TOLERANCE_S of the session's run.json start_time_utc - both are UTC and, measured on
a real pair, agree to the millisecond. If no traced run matches, the line reads *** LOG DOES NOT
BELONG TO THIS SESSION *** and the per-event join is SKIPPED; the gap distribution is still printed
because it is still a fact about that log. Without a run.json to check against, a single-segment log
is accepted with "run start time not checkable" and a multi-segment log falls back to matching
framesWritten against total_frames, joining only on a unique match.

This guard exists because the natural office invocation - one --log for a whole batch - would
otherwise attribute one run's pairing gaps to every session in the batch, silently and plausibly.

PURPOSE OF THE JOIN, CONTEXT ONLY: it separates "the arm-to-publish pairing gap owns the offset" from
"render-side latency owns it". No fix reasoning lives in this tool.

If no log is found the tool prints "no log found" and continues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Console: a header carrying the script version, every constant, the index convention and the sign
convention; then per session a schema line, an index-check line, a log line, and one table row per
anomaly type (two lines for contiguous types - startD and endD).
CSV: one row per EVENT, written to --csv (default ./measure_label_offset.csv), never into a session
directory. --series additionally dumps the per-frame signal series beside it.
--verbose adds one console line per event.

DETERMINISTIC: the same input produces byte-identical output. Nothing in the output is derived from
wall-clock time, randomness or filesystem enumeration order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    python measure_label_offset.py <session_dir> [<session_dir> ...]
    python measure_label_offset.py <root_dir_containing_sessions>
    python measure_label_offset.py A B --label editor-sve --label packaged-sve
    python measure_label_offset.py <dir> --log "<path to UE log>" --verbose --series
    python measure_label_offset.py --selftest

--selftest runs the MAGENTA/CHECKER classifier against synthetic patches with known answers and exits.
Worth running once on a machine you have not used this script on before: the detectors are built from
Pillow primitives, so a different Pillow build is the one thing that could silently change them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEASUREMENT CEILING - printed in every session header, not only per type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CEILING  *** MEASURABLE RANGE +/-N frames (min clean gap G, ...) - offsets beyond this are
             UNDER-READ, not absent ***

N = G // 2, where G is the smallest number of frames between two adjacent annotated windows. The
limit is STRUCTURAL, not a tuning choice: this tool attributes each frame to the nearer event using
the MIDPOINT between adjacent windows, so an offset larger than half the gap moves manifestation
across that boundary and it is assigned to the NEIGHBOURING event. On the standard 2/4/8/4/0 capture
config G is about 4 and the ceiling is about +/-2.

The per-type *** BASELINE CONTAMINATED *** banner is the softer, earlier warning - it fires as soon
as ONE reference frame is itself manifesting, which happens before the ceiling is reached. Both are
printed; neither replaces the other.

--require-gap N additionally EXITS NONZERO (4) when any session's clean gap is below N, so a
badly-configured office capture announces itself before anyone reads numbers off a screen.

Exit codes: 0 normal, 1 no session found, 2 Pillow missing, 3 selftest failed, 4 require-gap failed.
