# Gotchas (append-only)

Non-obvious lessons. Newest at the bottom. Never delete entries — supersede them.

### G1 — StackOBot is Blueprint-only but has stale `StackOBot` module binaries
The shipped project has no `Source/`, but `Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor-StackOBot.dll`,
`StackOBotEditor.target`, and `UnrealEditor.modules` exist with no matching source. Launching
as-is makes the editor try to load a missing module → "modules missing, rebuild?" prompt.
**Fix:** delete project-root `Binaries/` + `Intermediate/` (not `Saved/`), then add the
Route A game module and build. (Discovered 2026-06-08.)

### G2 — `GetActorLabel()` is editor-only
It is compiled out (`WITH_EDITOR`) and absent in cooked builds. We print the label in
`GDP.ListActors` guarded by `#if WITH_EDITOR`, but **matching must never use the label** —
`GDP.HideActor` matches actor Name or Class only, keeping it forward-compatible with cooked
builds.

### G3 — `SetActorHiddenInGame` hides in game/PIE, not the editor viewport
The anomaly is only visible when playing (PIE or standalone), which is exactly the data-gen
context. Don't expect the editing viewport to change when toggling hidden state.

### G4 — The Bot is runtime-spawned
StackOBot spawns the player Bot at play time, so it is not in the world at PIE start.
`GDP.HideActor Bot` only matches after the Bot exists. For a deterministic smoke test, hide a
**persistent level prop** (a `StaticMeshActor` in `MainWorld`) instead.

### G5 — `UTickableWorldSubsystem::GetStatId()` is pure-virtual
It must be overridden or the subsystem won't compile. Implement with
`RETURN_QUICK_DECLARE_CYCLE_STAT(UGDPAnomalyInjectorSubsystem, STATGROUP_Tickables);`.

### G6 — Plugin enablement via `EnabledByDefault: true` is project-plugin scoped
We enable the plugin through `"EnabledByDefault": true` in `GDPAnomalyInjector.uplugin` so the
`.uproject` needs no `Plugins[]` entry. This is fine while it lives in a **project's**
`Plugins/` folder. **Revisit if this ever becomes an engine plugin** (installed under the
engine's `Plugins/`): `EnabledByDefault` would then auto-enable it for *every* project on that
engine, which is almost certainly not what we want.

### G7 — Restrict the subsystem to Game + PIE worlds
`DoesSupportWorldType` returns true only for `EWorldType::Game` and `EWorldType::PIE`, so the
subsystem never instantiates or ticks in the editor preview/editing world. Consequence: the
`GDP.*` console commands resolve a null subsystem when run outside a game world — they
null-guard and log a clear warning rather than crashing.
